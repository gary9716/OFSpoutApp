Spout Application
<dl>
just put OFSpoutApp under the Openframeworks folder, so the structure would look like below(I test under openframework v0.9.8)<br/>
<pre>
of_v0.9.8_vs_release\
	OFSpoutApp\
		myApps\
		SpoutSDK\
	addons\
	examples\
...</pre>
</dl>

for the ofxBezierWarpManager addons, please use the version I forked(because there were some API adaption)
